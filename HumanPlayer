The HumanPlayer script is a script that allows a player in a game of DUO to play their turn.

The script has a list of Card objects called handList which represents the player's hand. It has a boolean variable skip which indicates whether the player should be skipped on their next turn, a boolean variable drew which indicates whether the player drew a card during their turn, and a boolean variable playedWild which indicates whether the player played a wild card during their turn. It also has a string variable name which holds the player's name.

The HumanPlayer class implements the PlayerInterface interface, which has a single method called turn(). This method is called at the start of the player's turn and it allows the player to play their cards. It loops through each Card object in the player's handList and checks if it can be played by checking if it is equal to the top card on the discard pile or if its number is greater than or equal to 13 (since cards with a number greater than or equal to 13 are special cards that can be played at any time). If the card can be played, it sets listeners on the card object so that it can be clicked and played. If the card cannot be played, it blackens out the card object.

The HumanPlayer class also has a turnEnd() function which is called when the player's turn ends. This function updates the game state, removes the listeners from the card objects in the player's hand, and ends the player's turn. It also has a recieveDrawOnTurn() function which is called when the player decides to draw a card, and an addCards() function which adds a card to the player's hand.
